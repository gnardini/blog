          longDescription="I iterated this project many times, it started as a plugin for VS Code, it turned into an electron app and now it also lives in GitHub as a Copilot alternative. It has some features that help me build faster with AI, such as having read-only access to my database, auto-opening relevant files depending on context and having firm control over the context window."

          longDescription="Locutio is a multi-step system that allows transforming any website into a multilingual one. First, it extracts hard-coded text from your code and moves it to JSON files using AI and then it translates that JSON into the target languages using AI. It can be hooked up to CI to keep your website translated automatically."

          longDescription="This one I didn't do by myself! I partenered with a friend to build this platform that makes it stupid easy to create courses, and sell them using Stripe. We also have a lot of features to help you manage your business, such creating a landing page, quizzing students, a forum to keep in touch with them, analytics to see how they are doing and more!"

I built this one to help me and my friends track our performance in ARAM games, it has a lot of stats that are not available in other options, and it grew a lot in the community on reddit's /r/ARAM"

          longDescription="After ARAM Zone, I took my learnings there to build a more comprehensive cool stats website for League of Legends. I find the usability much greater than other tools and it has a different set of stats than other websites, so I usually use this one when playing LoL."

          longDescription="I was really annoyed when I started using Celo that there was no good way to track my portfolio, so I built this one. It quickly grew in the Celo community to be the go-to tool for portfolio management. It allowed not only to track your portfolio but also to operate across different protocols."
